While hunting down a package on https://pkg.go.dev, I stumbled upon a delightful surprise in the "Links" section: there are custom links!!

![](/images/pkggodevlinks-package.png)

What is this magic?

<!--more-->

Let's go to find if there is a documentation about that!

After some digging, I landed on the [About](https://pkg.go.dev/about) page and discovered a section called [Adding links](https://pkg.go.dev/about#adding-links).

But this section is a bit sparse about the topic: it's just a reference to the issue [42968](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42968).

As an open source maintainer, I know that issues are not really the best documentation, the initial concept often morphs as ideas evolve.

I dove into the code itself and found even more than what the issue hinted at.

## ‚ùì How?

Note: The repository must have a license that follow the [license policy](https://pkg.go.dev/license-policy).

### readme.md syntax

```markdown
## Links

- [Title from readme 1](https://example.com)
- [Title from readme 2](https://example.org)
```

The heading level is not important, it can be `#`, `##`, `###`, etc.

### godoc syntax

```go
// Package foo Paneer fromage babybel.
// Ricotta paneer monterey jack parmesan cheesecake who moved my cheese bavarian bergkase cheeseburger. 
//
// Links
//
// - Title from godoc 1, https://example.com
// - Title from godoc 2, https://example.org
package foo
```

## ü™ß Where?

There are several ways to add links:

- the `readme.md` file
  - at the "root/module" level
  - inside any package level
- the package godoc
  - at the "root/module" level
  - inside any package level

## Hierarchy of the Links

```md
. (links from readme.md and godoc)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pkga (links from "root/module" readme.md)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pkgb (links from "root/module" readme.md + package readme.md)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pkgd (links from "root/module" readme.md + package godoc)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pkgc (links from "root/module" readme.md + package godoc + package readme.md)
```

At the "root/module" level, the links from `readme.md` and/or godoc will be displayed.

At the package level (not the "root/module" level):
- if you have links inside the `readme.md` of this package:
  - the links from the package `readme.md` (and from the "root/module" `readme.md`) will be displayed
- if you have link inside the godoc of this package:
  - the links from the godoc (and from the "root/module" `readme.md`) the package will be displayed
- if you have no package `readme.md` and no package godoc:
  - the links from the "root/module" `readme.md` will be displayed

The links from godoc are not transitives: the links from the parent package are not displayed.

The links from `readme.md` are partially transitives: only the "root/module" `readme.md` will be used.
