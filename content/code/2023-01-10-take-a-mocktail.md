Mocktail: The Mock Generator for Strongly-Typed Mocks Youâ€™ve Been Looking For.

<!--more-->

I wrote an article about Mocktail inside the Traefik Labs: https://traefik.io/blog/mocktail-the-mock-generator-for-strongly-typed-mocks/

And the article has been promoted inside the Go Weekly Newsletter: https://golangweekly.com/issues/445

I very happy and proud of that.
